        <h2>Mental Health Overview and Stigma</h2>
        <p>Mental health, a cornerstone of overall well-being, is often shrouded in societal stigma. This stigma, rooted in misconceptions and fear, poses significant barriers to seeking help and fostering open conversations. Overcoming this challenge requires collective efforts to educate, raise awareness, and debunk myths surrounding mental health. By dismantling stigma, we pave the way for a more compassionate society where individuals feel empowered to discuss their mental health challenges openly, without judgment. Breaking down these walls not only encourages seeking help but also contributes to creating a world where mental health is valued, understood, and prioritized on par with physical health</p>
